=head1 NAME

MS::Reader::ProtXML - A simple but complete protXML parser

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use MS::Reader::ProtXML;

    my $res = MS::Reader::ProtXML->new('res.prot.xml');

    while (my $grp = $res->next_group) {

        # $res is a MS::Reader::ProtXML::Group object

    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<MS::Reader::ProtXML> is a parser for the protXML format for storing protein
identification in mass spectrometry.



=head1 INHERITANCE

C<MS::Reader::ProtXML> is a subclass of L<MS::Reader::XML>, which in turn
inherits from L<MS::Reader>, and inherits the methods of these parental
classes. Please see the documentation for those classes for details of
available methods not detailed below.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

    my $res = MS::Reader::ProtXML->new( $fn,
        use_cache => 0,
        paranoid  => 0,
    );

Takes an input filename (required) and optional argument hash and returns an
C<MS::Reader::ProtXML> object. This constructor is inherited directly from
L<MS::Reader>. Available options include:

=over

=item * use_cache — cache fetched records in memory for repeat access
(default: FALSE)

=item * paranoid — when loading index from disk, recalculates MD5 checksum
each time to make sure raw file hasn't changed. This adds (typically) a few
seconds to load times. By default, only file size and mtime are checked.

=back

=head2 next_group

    while (my $grp = $res->next_group) {
        # do something
    }

Returns an C<MS::Reader::ProtXML::Group object representing the next protein
group in the file, or C<undef> if the end of records has been reached.
Typically used to iterate over each group in the run.

=head2 fetch_group

    my $grp = $res->fetch_group($idx);

Takes a single argument (zero-based group index) and returns an
C<MS::Reader::ProtXML::Group> object representing the protein group at that
index.  Throws an exception if the index is out of range.

=head1 CAVEATS AND BUGS

The API is in alpha stage and is not guaranteed to be stable.

Please reports bugs or feature requests through the issue tracker at
L<https://github.com/jvolkening/p5-MS/issues>.
