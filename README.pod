=head1 NAME

MS - Namespace for mass spectrometry-related libraries

=head1 DESCRIPTION

NOTE: The current API is undergoing daily development and frequent minor
changes. This notice will be removed when the API is considered stable.

The C<MS::> namespace is intended as a hub for mass spectrometry-related
development in Perl. This core package includes a number of parsers for HUPO
PSI standards and other common file formats, as well as core functionality for
mass spectrometry and proteomics work. Developers are encouraged to put their
work under the C<MS::> namespace. The following namespace hierarchy is
suggested:

=over

=item * C<MS::Reader::> — format-specific file readers/parsers 

=item * C<MS::Writer::> — format-specific file writers/formatters

=item * C<MS::Search::> — search-related modules (front-ends, etc)

=item * C<MS::Algo::> — algorithm implementations (prototyping, etc)
